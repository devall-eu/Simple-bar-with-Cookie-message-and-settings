With Cookie Policy explains what cookies are and how we use them, the types of cookies we use i.e, the information we collect using cookies and how that information is used and how to control the cookie preferences.

Using jQuery and parameters, the user can specify the display, text content and basic appearance of the message. After confirming the cookies, a link is still visible where the user can read custom text on the link.

JavaScript contains formatting, which we will specify through the view file, where we call the JavaScript function. This way you can use all the settings through the interface where the user selects all the options of the message.
